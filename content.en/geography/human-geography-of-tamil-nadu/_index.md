# Introduction

Human geography refers to the study of ways of development of human societies and their operation in relation to their physical environment. This chapter focuses on the distribution, characteristics and utilisation of different resources in Tamil Nadu. We have studied earlier that the earth is endowed with a variety of natural resources such as landforms, rivers, soil, natural vegetation, water and wildlife. These resources are useful only when they are utilised. Human beings use these resources using their intelligence and skill. Thus, the human beings are the most significant resource on the earth surface. They turn all these natural resources into useful products with their skills and abilities.

## 7.1 Agriculture

The word "agriculture" is derived from the Latin words **"ager and cultura"**, which means field and growing. Agriculture is a practice of farming that includes the cultivation of crops, rearing of animals, birds, forestry, fisheries and other related activities. Agriculture is the major occupation in Tamil Nadu. Agriculture has been the mainstay of the state’s economy since independence with more than 65% of the population depends upon this sector for their living. Agriculture provides employment for rural people on a large scale. There is a strong link between agriculture and economic growth. Paddy, millets and pulses are the principal food crops of the state. Sugarcane, cotton, sunflower, coconut, cashew, chillies, gingelly, groundnut, tea, coffee, cardamom and rubber are the major commercial crops.

## 7.2 Geographical determinants of Agriculture

Landform, climate, soil and irrigation are the factors that determine the growth of agriculture.

**Landform** 

Tamil Nadu is a land of diverse landscape comprising of hills, plateaus and plains. Among them the plains are most suitable for agriculture. The plains with alluvial soil enhances agricultural productivity. Example: Plains of cauvery. Agriculture in the plateau is moderate and is poor on the hills.


**Climate**

Tamil Nadu is situated in the tropical zone, which is nearer to the equator. The state experiences a tropical climate. Hence, the temperature in Tamil Nadu is relatively high almost throughout the year. So, only the tropical crops are cultivated. Water is another limiting factor of agriculture. Northeast monsoon is the major source of rainfall for Tamil Nadu. Therefore, the major cropping season begins with this season. The rainfall in this season and the irrigation facilities affect agriculture to a large extent.

**Soil** 

Soil is one of the most essential elements of agriculture. It provides essential minerals or nutrients for the growth of crops and vegetation. The regions of river valleys and the coastal plains are the most agriculturally productive regions of the state as they are covered with fertile alluvial soil.

**Irrigation** 

Monsoon rainfall in the state is highly irregular. Further it is seasonal. Hence, irrigation becomes necessary for successful cultivation of crops in the state. In the dry regions, rain-fed crops are cultivated.

**Types and regions of Agriculture Practices in Tamil Nadu**


| Farming type |Area practiced |
|------|------|
| Subsistence intensive agriculture |Practiced all over Tamil Nadu with few exceptions. |
| Plantation Agriculture |Hill slopes of Eastern and Western Ghats. |
| Mixed farming |Banks of River Cauvery and Thenpennai. |


## 7.3 Cropping Seasons in Tamil Nadu

Farmers select different crops for different seasons of cultivation. It is based on the temperature and availability of moisture in the soil. Accordingly, the state has the following cropping seasons.

| Name |Sowing |Harvesting |Major crops |
|------|------|------|------|
| Sornavari(chittirai pattam ) |April-May |August-September |Millets and cotton |
| Samba (Adipattam) |July-August |January-Februar y |Paddy and sugarcane |
| Navarai |November-December |Februar y-March |Fruits, vegetables,cucumber andwatermelon |


## 7.4 Distribution of major crops in Tamil Nadu

**Paddy** 

Paddy is the most important staple food crop of Tamil Nadu. Ponni and kichadi samba are the major varieties of paddy grown in Tamil Nadu. Though it is cultivated all over Tamil Nadu, its cultivation is highly concentrated in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Cuddalore and

![**Paddy Cultivation**](1.png)

Tirunelveli districts. It ranks third in the production of rice among the states of India. The deltaic region of river cauvery (the undivided Thanjavur district) is the major rice-producing region of Tamil Nadu. So, this region is rightly called as the **"Granary of Tamil Nadu."**

**Millets** 

Millets form staple food of nearly one-third of human population of Tamil Nadu. Sorghum/jowar (cholam), ragi (kezhvaragu) and bajra (kambu) are the major millets. These are grown not only in drier areas but also in the coastal plains. Sorghum is grown in the Coimbatore plateau and Kambam valley. Ragi is grown in Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Vellore and Cuddalore districts. Bajra is mostly cultivated in Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli, Karur, Perambalur and Salem districts.

>India observed 2018 as national year of millets. FAO has decided to observe 2023 as the International year of millets.

**Pulses** 

Pulses are the major source of protein.Bengal gram, black gram, green gram, cowpea and horse gram are the important pulses grown in Tamil Nadu. Pulses are grown in a wide range of climatic conditions mostly in drier regions with or without irrigation. Mild cool climate and a low to moderate rainfall are best suited for these crops. Pulses serve as excellent fodder. Pulses are grown in almost all districts in the state except Chennai, Nilgiris and Kanyakumari. Coimbatore leads in the production of Bengal gram. Vellore and Kanyakumari districts produce red gram.

Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Thoothukudi districts are the principal producers of green gram and black gram. Horse gram is widely cultivated in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts.

**Oil Seeds** 

Groundnut, gingelly castor, coconut,sunflower and mustard are some of the oilseeds that are grown in Tamil Nadu. Apart from its use in food preparation, it is used in industries as a lubricant, in the manufacture of varnish, soaps, candles, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Groundnut is the major oilseed of the state. The cultivation of groundnut is mostly concentrated in Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram, Salem and Pudukottai districts. It is also grown to some extent in Dharmapuri, Cuddalore, Perambalur and Madurai. Erode, Ramanathapuram, Sivagangai and Virudhunagar districts are its minor producers. Coconut is grown in Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Kanyakumari districts.

**Sugarcane** 

It is one of the major cash crops of the state. It is an annual crop. It requires high temperature and heavy rainfall. It grows well in the tropical region. Major sugarcane-producing districts are Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Vellore, Cuddalore, Tiruchirapalli, Coimbatore, Erode and Tirunelveli.

**Cotton** 

Cotton is a fibre and cash crop. It requires black soil, long frost-free condition and warm and humid weather for its cultivation. Humid weather in the early stages and hot, dry weather during harvest period is suitable for this crop. It is predominantly cultivated in Coimbatore plateau and Vaigai-Vaippar river basins. It is also cultivated in Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Salem and Dharmapuri districts.

## 7.5 Livestock/Animal Husbandry

Livestock has remained an integral part of socio-economic fabric of rural people.

**Goat** Goat is also known as **‘poor man’s cow’** in India. It forms a very important component in dry land farming system. In the marginal or undulating lands unsuitable for rearing of other types of cattle like cow or buffalo, goat is the best alternative. With very low investments, goat rearing can be made into a profitable venture for small and marginal farmers.

**Sheep** 

Sheep is used for multiple purposes like wool, meat, milk, skins and manure, and forms an important component of the rural economy, particularly in the arid, semi-arid and mountainous areas of Tamil Nadu. It provides a dependable source of income to the shepherds through the sale of wool and animals.

**Fishing**

Since Tamil Nadu is a coastal state, fishing is one of the major occupations in the state. With widespread reservoirs and rivers, inland fishing also is also seen to a considerable extent.

**Marine Fishing** 

An area of 41,412 sq.km of continental shelves of the state favours coastal fishing and Tamil Nadu is one of the leading states in marine fish production. Marine fishing is also called inshore fish or neritic fishing, carried out in oceans and seas. Large mechanised boats are used for fishing. In ocean or seawaters, fishing within few kilometres from the shoreline is called inshore fishing and the fishing far from the shore typically 20–30 miles out in water hundreds and thousands of feet deep is called off-shore fishing. The fish varieties caught are sharks, flying fish, counch, catfish, silver bellies, and crabs. Chennai, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and Ramanathapuram districts contribute about 40% to marine fish production in the state. Their coastal location favours fishing in these regions.

  

**Inland Fishing** 

Inland fishing is carried out in lakes,rivers, ponds, estuaries, backwaters and swamps. Oysters and prawns are cultured in original nurseries. Catamaran, diesel boats and floating nets are used in fishing. Tamil Nadu Fisheries Department has introduced several programmes for the betterment of fishing. Vellore district leads in the production of inland fish production with 10% of state’s production. Cuddalore, Sivagangai and Virudhunagar districts stand second with 9% of inland fish catch each.

## 7.6 Water Resource

Water is the precious gift of nature to humankind and millions of other species living on the earth.

Tamil Nadu constitutes 4% of India’s land area and is inhabited by 6% of India’s population, but has only 2.5% percent of India’s water resources. More than 95% of the surface water and 80% of the ground water have already been put into use.

**Water Resource Management**

Water resource management is the activity of planning, developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of water resources. The demand for water in Tamil Nadu is increasing at a fast rate both due to increasing population and also due to larger per capita needs triggered by economic growth. Demands from other sectors such as domestic and industries have been growing significantly. The state is heavily dependent on monsoon rains. Since the state is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute water scarcity and severe droughts. So, it is important to save water for us and the future generation.
