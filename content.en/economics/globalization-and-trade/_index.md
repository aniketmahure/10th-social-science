**Archaic Globalization**

Andre Gunder Frank argued that a form of globalization has been in existence since the rise of trade links between Sumer and Indus valley civilization in the third millennium BC (BCE). An early form of globalized economics and culture, known as Archaic globalization existed during the Hellenistic Age. An early form of globalization in the trade link between the Roman Empire, Parthian Empire and the Han Dynasty made the commercial links between these powers inspired the development of the Silk Road.

The Islamic Age was also an important early stage of globalization. The advent of the Mongol Empire, though destabilizing to the commercial

centers of the Middle East and China, greatly facilitated travel along the Silk Road. These Pre- modern phase of global exchange are sometimes known as archaic globalization.

**Proto Globalization**

The next phase is known as proto - globalization. It was charterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the Portugues and Spanish Empires, and Dutch and British empires. In the 17th century, globalization became private business phenomenon like British East India Company\[founded in 1600\] described as the first multinational company, and the first Dutch East India Company \[found in 1602\] were established.

**Modern Globalization**

The 19th century witnessed the advent of globalization approaching its modern form. Between the globalization in the 19th and in he 20th century there are significant differences. There are two main points one is the global trade in his centuries as well as the capital, investment and the economy and another one is the global trade in the 20th century shows a higher share of trade in merchant production, a growth of the trade in services and the rise of production and trade by multinational firms.

## 2.3 Trade and Traders in South India historical perspective

Southern Indian trade guilds were formed by merchants in order to organize and expand their trading activities. Trade guilds become channels through which Indian culture was exported to other lands. **Early Traders**

In the year 1053 AD (CE) the Kalinga traders (Modern Odisha) brought red colored stone decorative objects for trade and also cotton textile to Southeast Asia at an early date.

**European Traders**

This was due to the trading activities of the various European companies which came to India during this period. The discovery of a new all-sea route from Europe to India Via cape of Good Hope by Vasco do Gama had for reaching repercussions on the civilized world.

**The Portuguese**

The Portuguese under the leadership of Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut on May, 1498. Profits of goods brought by Vasco do Gama to Portugal were to 60 times cost of the entire expedition to India. The second trip of Vasco da Gama in 1502 led to the establishment of trading station at Calicut Cochin and Cannanore. Cochin was the early capital of the Portuguese in India.

**The Dutch**

Dutch undertook several voyages from 1596 and formed the Dutch East India company (VOC) I 1602. In 1605, Admiral van der Hagen established Dutch Factory at Masulipatnam and Pettapoli (Nizamapatanam), Devanampatinam. In 1610, upon negotiating with the king of Chandragiri, found another facatory at Pulicut. Other commodities exported by the Dutch were indigo, and Bengal raw silk. Pulicut was the headquarters of the Dutch in India.

**The British**

On 31st December, 1600, Queen Elizabeth granted charter to The East India Company. On the south-eastern coast, the English established at Masulipatnam in 1611 and near Pulical in 1626. The Sultan of Golconda granted the English the “Golden Fireman” in 1632 by which they were allowed to trade freely in their “Kingdom Ports”. In 1639, built a fortified factory in Madras which known as Fort St.George, which soon displaced Masulipatnam as headquarters of the English settlement on the coromandel coast.

**The Danes**

The Danes formed an East India company and arrive in India in 1616. The Danish  settlements were established at Tranguebar ( in Tamil nadu) in 1620 which was the headquarters of Danes in India. They failed to strengthen themselves, in India and in 1845 were forced to sell all their India settlements to the British.

**The French**

The first French factory in India was established in 1668 by obtaining permission from the Sultan of Golconda. In 1693, the Dutch captured Pondicherry but was handed back to the French. In 1701, Pondicherry was the headquarters of the French.

## 2.4 Globalization in India

When the new government took over in June 1991. India had unprecedented balance of payment crisis.

With the downgrading of India’s credit rating by some international agencies, there was heavy flight of capital out of India.

Since India lost its credit worthiness in the international market, the government mortgaged 40 tons of gold to the Bank of England. Under these circumstances, the government for 1991-92 presented its budget in July 1991 with a series of policy changes which underlined globalization, liberalization and privatization. This has come to be called as India’s new economic policy. This policies were strengthened when India signed the Dunkel Draft in 1994.
