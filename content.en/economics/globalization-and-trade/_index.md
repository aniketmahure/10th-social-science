centers of the Middle East and China, greatly facilitated travel along the Silk Road. These Pre- modern phase of global exchange are sometimes known as archaic globalization.

**European Traders**

This was due to the trading activities of the various European companies which came to India during this period. The discovery of a new all-sea route from Europe to India Via cape of Good Hope by Vasco do Gama had for reaching repercussions on the civilized world.

**The Portuguese**

The Portuguese under the leadership of Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut on May, 1498. Profits of goods brought by Vasco do Gama to Portugal were to 60 times cost of the entire expedition to India. The second trip of Vasco da Gama in 1502 led to the establishment of trading station at Calicut Cochin and Cannanore. Cochin was the early capital of the Portuguese in India.

**The Dutch**

Dutch undertook several voyages from 1596 and formed the Dutch East India company (VOC) I 1602. In 1605, Admiral van der Hagen established Dutch Factory at Masulipatnam and Pettapoli (Nizamapatanam), Devanampatinam. In 1610, upon negotiating with the king of Chandragiri, found another facatory at Pulicut. Other commodities exported by the Dutch were indigo, and Bengal raw silk. Pulicut was the headquarters of the Dutch in India.

**The British**

On 31st December, 1600, Queen Elizabeth granted charter to The East India Company. On the south-eastern coast, the English established at Masulipatnam in 1611 and near Pulical in 1626. The Sultan of Golconda granted the English the “Golden Fireman” in 1632 by which they were allowed to trade freely in their “Kingdom Ports”. In 1639, built a fortified factory in Madras which known as Fort St.George, which soon displaced Masulipatnam as headquarters of the English settlement on the coromandel coast.

**The Danes**

The Danes formed an East India company and arrive in India in 1616. The Danish  

settlements were established at Tranguebar ( in Tamil nadu) in 1620 which was the headquarters of Danes in India. They failed to strengthen themselves, in India and in 1845 were forced to sell all their India settlements to the British.

**The French**

The first French factory in India was established in 1668 by obtaining permission from the Sultan of Golconda. In 1693, the Dutch captured Pondicherry but was handed back to the French. In 1701, Pondicherry was the headquarters of the French.

**2.4 Globalization in India** In India the period after 1980-81 was

marked by severe balance of payment difficulties mainly due to hike in oil price and Gulf war in 1990-91 and hostilities in West Asia.

When the new government took over in June 1991. India had unprecedented balance of payment crisis.

With the downgrading of India’s credit rating by some international agencies, there was heavy flight of capital out of India.

Since India lost its credit worthiness in the international market, the government mortgaged 40 tons of gold to the Bank of England. Under these circumstances, the government for 1991-92 presented its budget in July 1991 with a series of policy changes which underlined globalization, liberalization and privatization. This has come to be called as India’s new economic policy. This policies were strengthened when India signed the Dunkel Draft in 1994.

In to the manufacturing and service sectors after 1950s. Most of the MNC’s at present belong to the four major exporting countries viz., USA, UK, France, Germany. However, the largest is American. 11 of the 15 largest multinationals are Americans.

**Growth of MNCs in India**

A common form of MNC Participation in Indian industry is through entering into cooperation with Indian industrialist. Trends

**MNC Company**  

of liberalization in the 1980s gave a substantial spurt to foreign collaborations. This would be clear from the fact that of the total 12,760 foreign collaboration agreements signed between 1948- 1988.
